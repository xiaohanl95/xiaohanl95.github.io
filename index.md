title: "About me"
---

I am currently a [CIMES Postdoctoral Research Associate]](https://cimes.princeton.edu/) in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University. My research interests include environmental chemistry and microphysics, and I am particularly interested about how these fundamental sciences influence climate. Currently, my research aims to bridge the gap between the nanoscale foundation of aerosol microphysics and its representation in GFDL climate models.
