     <p>I am currently a <a href="https://cimes.princeton.edu/">CIMES Postdoctoral Research Associate</a> in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University. I have a broad interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_chemistry">environmental chemistry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry">geochemistry</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry">physical chemistry</a>. Specifically, I focus on interfacial phenomena. I'm profoundly interested in understanding how these foundational sciences affect the environment, energy, and our climate. Currently, my research aims to **bridge the gap between the nanoscale foundation of aerosol microphysics and its representation in GFDL climate models**.     </p>
