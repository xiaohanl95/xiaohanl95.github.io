# Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Nanoscale Interfaces
> During my PhD, I was frequently asked by experimentalists about the trustworthiness of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in characterizing the real physics or chemistry, considering their limitations. In this section, I would like to share my views on the limitations of MD, the extent to which we should value MD results, current research status and technical issues related to the characterization of nanodroplets and more general interfaces, for both experimentalists and MD simulation researchers.

# Aerosol Microphysics and Atmospheric Modeling


# Bridging Nanoscale Knowledge with Large-Scale Impacts
> At the AGU 2019 conference, a colleague working on climate models stopped by my poster and suggested that climate modelers don't care about the nanoscale, making my research seem useless to them. This was disappointing at first, but it sparked a question in my mind throughout my research journey: **how can nanoscale findings be made more accessible and applicable for large-scale applications?** Fortunately, I believe I have found my own way on how to approach this challenge by aerosol microphysics. I would like to share some of my personal thoughts and experiences on dealing with this mindset, for younger researchers who may also struggle with similar issues.
