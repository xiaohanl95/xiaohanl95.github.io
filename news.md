- Alongside Matt, Arman, Fei, and Stephan, we demonstrated the impact of the Coriolis force on Earth system through an experiment with a rotation tank at the Spring Into Science outreach event for 4th to 10th students in the New Jersey community. This experience has been rewarding, prompting me to reflect more deeply on inclusivity within thecommunity.
