# Academic Activities
<span style="color: gray;"><strong>*I pursue collaborative research opportunities to explore innovative solutions to complex environmental challenges, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and encouraging a supportive atmosphere for diverse perspectives.*</strong> </span>
**2024-08 ACS Fall Meeting.** I will give an invited talk at the 2024 ACS Fall meeting in Denver, presenting how molecular dynamics simulations can bridge knowledge gaps regarding water film energetics on clay minerals across various relative humidity conditions, from low to saturation.

**2024-04 C. Ellen Gonter Award.** I am honored to receive the 2023 American Chemistry Society Division of Environmental Chemistry C. Ellen Gonter Award. This prestigious award is presented to graduate students at U.S. and international universities who submit the highest quality research papers. It is the highest honor granted by the Division of Environmental Chemistry for students. 

**2024-03 ACS Spring Meeting.** I presented at the 2024 ACS Spring meeting in New Orleans, discussing the hygroscopic growth of adsorbed water films on smectite clay nano-particles.

# Service and Outreach
<span style="color: gray;"><strong>*I pursue fostering a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment within our community. I anticipate collaborating with the committee to advance these crucial values.*</strong> </span>

**2024-04 Spring Into Science Event, Science Outreach Program.** Our team demonstrated the impact of the Coriolis force on the Earth system through an engaging experiment with a rotating tank for 4th to 10th-grade students in the New Jersey community, aiming to make science more accessible for young learners.

**2024-02 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee.** I am excited to serve as the Postdoc representative on the DEI committee for the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University.
